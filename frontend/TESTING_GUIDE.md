## üß™ Testing Overview

This guide provides comprehensive testing procedures for the IRIS Real-Time Facial Analysis Platform to ensure optimal performance across different devices and browsers.

## üöÄ Quick Start Testing

### 1. Basic Functionality Test
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Open browser to http://localhost:3000
# Click "Enable Camera" button
# Allow camera permissions when prompted
# Verify face detection overlays appear
```

### 2. Performance Verification
```bash
# Run setup verification
node scripts/test-face-analysis.js

# Expected output:

- Multiple face detection (up to 10 faces)

**Test Steps:**
1. Open application in browser
2. Enable camera and verify video stream
3. Check performance monitor (click activity icon)
4. Verify face detection with bounding boxes
5. Test age, gender, and emotion detection
6. Monitor FPS and memory usage over 5 minutes

### Mobile Testing (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
**Target Performance:**
- 10+ FPS processing
- <150ms processing time per frame
- <150MB memory usage
- Stable detection with 3-5 faces

**Test Steps:**
1. Open application on mobile browser
2. Test both front and back camera
3. Verify orientation changes work correctly
4. Check battery usage during extended use
5. Test performance in low-light conditions
6. Verify touch controls work properly

### Low-End Device Testing
**Expected Behavior:**

- Disabled emotion detection
- Limited to 3 faces maximum

**Test Steps:**
1. Open on older mobile device or low-spec computer
2. Verify automatic optimization kicks in
3. Check performance monitor shows "Low" quality
4. Confirm stable operation without crashes

## üêõ Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Camera Not Working
**Symptoms:** Black screen, permission denied
**Solutions:**
1. Ensure HTTPS in production (required for camera access)
2. Check browser permissions in settings
3. Try different browser or incognito mode
4. Verify camera is not used by another application

### Issue: Poor Performance
**Symptoms:** Low FPS, high processing time
**Solutions:**
1. Close other browser tabs and applications
2. Enable battery saving mode
3. Reduce video quality in settings
4. Check performance monitor for recommendations

### Issue: Face Detection Not Working
**Symptoms:** No bounding boxes, no analysis results
**Solutions:**
1. Verify AI models are downloaded correctly
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Ensure good lighting conditions
4. Try different face angles and distances

### Issue: Memory Usage High
**Symptoms:** Browser becomes slow, crashes
**Solutions:**
1. Click "Clean Memory" in performance monitor
2. Restart the application
3. Reduce maximum faces setting
4. Enable battery saving mode
